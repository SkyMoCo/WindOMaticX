I wrote this while I was waiting for the circuit boards to arrive from China.

Turns a toilet paper roll into a wire winder.   TP roll is 42.6 mm in diameter.   So 13.38 mm (2pi * r) is the amount of wire per rotation.

There are three buttons that do different things depending on the mode.

Button 1 - Changes the mode

    Adjust mode
        Right button turns the spool in the counter-clockwise direction
        Left button turns the spool in the clockwise direction
    
    Set Length mode
        Right button reduces the length (defaults to )
        Left Button increases the length

    Run mode
        Right button starts the Run
        Left button stops the run immediatly
